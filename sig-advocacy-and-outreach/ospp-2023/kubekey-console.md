* React
* Docker、Kubernetes

## Background

KubeKey is an open-source lightweight tool for Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management. It provides a flexible and fast way to install Kubernetes/K3s, Kubernetes/K3s with KubeSphere, and other cloud-native components. Its main features include:

- Cluster lifecycle management (installation, scaling, upgrade, and uninstallation)
- Quick creation of offline installation packages
- Support for managing cluster lifecycle using CRDs (Kubernetes Cluster API Provider)

As the functionality of KubeKey continues to expand, there is also an increasing amount of configurable content. Therefore, we need to develop a graphical user interface for the KubeKey to reduce complexity and provide users with a more user-friendly way to manage the lifecycle of their clusters.


## Project Details

Develop the KubeKey graphical user interface to support cluster lifecycle management (installation, scaling, upgrade) and basic information display.

The aim of this project is to provide users with a more intuitive way to access KubeKey's flexible and rich functionality through a graphical user interface. It will also provide users with a more convenient and user-friendly method for maintaining their clusters.

## Outcomes

- Interfaces related to cluster lifecycle management (installation, scaling, upgrade)
- Interface for displaying basic cluster information
- Output your understanding of KubeKey
